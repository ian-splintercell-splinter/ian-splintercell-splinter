Working Eccomerce example PHP MySQL Development!

Product check out included but not configured for PayPall
inclusion would be easy enougth. You would just need to contact your 
bank manager. Products are not real so dont
enter your proper credit card details enter dummy ones.
change database settings to match your own. in file see directory
 db_fns.php here!
("$result = new mysqli('localhost', 'book_sc', 'password', 'book_sc');")


Reused code using stepwise refinement from 
PHP and MySQL Web development by Luke Welling, and Laura Thomson. 
This is one of my examples on host server. Im new to to this so unsure 
about javascript menu inclusion, because of links
if it infringes any rules for repository inclusion let me know.And i will amend.
